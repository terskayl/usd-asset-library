### Database Setup
MySQL is local to your machine so you would have to set it up. (obviously there are ways of deploying, not sure how yet.)
1. Install MySQL if you havenâ€™t already.
2. Create a new database:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE assets;
   ```
   You can try using the root MySQL user or make your own (MySQL users are different across machines so ignore the passwords in info.txt. The Django superuser password is in there tho)
   To make your own account:
   ```CREATE USER 'your_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'your_password';
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON assets.* TO 'your_user'@'localhost';
    FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
   ```
   Then import the backup if you want the database already populated
   ```
   mysql -u your_user -p assets < filepath_to/database_backup.sql
   ```
   your_user can also be root, your database name should be 'assets'.

### Django
   Make sure you have Django and python's MySQL connection packages installed.
   ```
   pip install Django  
   pip install mysqlclient
   ```
   If you are on Windows and encounter errors (I am on Windows and I did not), you can try 
   `
   pip install mysql-connector-python` instead.  
   To start the server, use manage.py in the asset_library folder  
   Open shell in asset_library folder  
   ```
   python manage.py runserver
   ```
